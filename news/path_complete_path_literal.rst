**Changed:**

* Remove p-string prefix from partial string detected in ``xonsh.completers.path_path_from_partial_string``, such that partial string is returned.
* Strip leading ``p`` from quote used by ``xonsh.completers.path_path_from_partial_string`` to obtain the start of the path. This allows path completion to work as before, but preserves the leading ``p`` of the path literal already present on the command line.
